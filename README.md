# General Cisco
ios-backup.yml - creates folders for each device and saves a time stamped backup in that device's folder<br>
<br>
cisco-ios-snmp.yml - adds snmp settings to devices based on the snmp_settings.yml file.<br>
<br>
aci-epg-demo.yml - This connects to a Cisco ACI SDN controller and creates a tenant, an app profile, an VRF, a bridge domain, and 10 EPGs.  I heavily use variable replacement, all of which are easily understood in the playbook itself.  I have a blogpost explaining the usage of the script here http://gregsowell.com/?p=6410.<br>
